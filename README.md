# LSTM_Periodic_Function
Experiment for my thesis. In this repository I will test the predictive quality of an LSTM on a periodic function with different sampling rates, types (and levels) of noise and amount of previous values given as input. The training progress will be saved as raw data under Results/Training. The trained weights are stored in the Weights folder. Finally the trained network is tested on the periodic function and the result is stored in a table in the Results folder.
